Jumping into Python

I've no prior experience in either python or data science. Recently I signed up for this course at https://padhai.onefourthlabs.in/ where they focus on teaching through practice via contests in kaggle instead of just the theory.

All the courses I've seen online focuses on these topics, when it comes to python for DataScience.

Make yourself familiar with the Python 3 datatypes, inbuilt data structures, control structures and functions using the following files and links:
