The [ML Fundamentals](./machine-learning-fundamentals) article described how everything falls into place. With this one we will explore how to proceed further so that we can use the 6 blocks like a framework while proceeding further.

1. Un-Supervised Tasks

   - clustering
     - group similar data
   - anamoly / fraud detection
   - generation of new data
     - generate something like a trump tweet

2. Supervised Tasks
   - classification
   - regression
   - prediction

Model

- Sigmoid functions
- Deep neural networks
- Deep convolutional networks
- Recurrent Neural networks


Loss

- squared error loss
- Cross Entropy Loss
- KL divergence

Learning Algo

- Gradient Descent ++
- Adagrad
- RMSprop
- Adam

Evaluation

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
