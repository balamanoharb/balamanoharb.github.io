## What is an Expert System ?

Consider

The final capstone project for this course is to recognize any language on a board. With the context of this we are interested in Binary Classification.

Expert System

Input => Rule Engine based on human intelligence and past experience => out put

series of if/else stmts

Use Cases

- organic chemistry - find structures of chemicals based on rules designed by experts in that field
- space program - mission control before ignition - 1990 - series of conditions
- mortgage and loan

Human experts interprets data and gives out result. Convert the process to a rule based system

identifying the functions

- deeplearning algorithms
  - this gives us a set of functions
    - help identify the parameters

Why has Machine Learning become famous

Abundant Data

- text
- images
- audio
- video

- structured data like tables
- social media, e com,

Abundant Data => democratazed model and learning algorithms => Computing power

- lot of data. What to do with it ?
  - manually classify them initially - collect, curate and define tasks
- identified tasks what to do next ?
  - ML engineering
    - which is the right algorithm to use ?
      - deep learning algorithms
      - logistic regression
      - graphical models
- ML researchers
  - Fast
  - Efficient
  - Better

Manufacturers - Car Expert - Customers who give more and more data

## Six Elements of Machine Learning

- specific to this course
- gives a lot of clarity

The final capstone project for this course is to recognize any language on a board. With the context of this we are interested in Binary Classification.

Expert System

Input => Rule Engine based on human intelligence and past experience => out put

series of if/else stmts

Use Cases

- 1965 - organic chemistry - find structures of chemicals based on rules designed by experts in that field
- 1990 - space program - mission control before ignition - series of conditions
- 1990 - mortgage and loan
- 1995 - bots
